Each engine is operated until failure under variable operational settings. In our earlier exploratory notebooks, we discovered that there were actually only six different operational configurations rather than a continuum. We've encoded those operational configurations and already constructed dummy columns indicating which configuration the engine is operating under at a given time. Additionally, we've identified seven of the initial 20 sensors which show an association with `RUL`. That is the data set for which we will work with now.\n","\n","As one more preparatory step, we've split the dataset up into *training*, *test*, and *safe* sets.

I don't expect a multiple linear regression model to perform well for a remaining useful life (RUL) task because the linear regresion model has no way to prioritize accurate predictions for units nearing end of life (EOL). The model will optimize over all cases it receives -- that is, even though we care most about accurate predictions within the last say 10 or 15 time cycles, the model will also fit to observations with very long remaining useful life. Still, a linear regression model may prove as a useful sanity check and benchmark for a more powerful model.\n","\n","One thing we could do here to help our linear regression model is to engineer a few new features. We noted that near end of life, many sensor readings showed a climb in their reported values. For this reason, let's engineer a new feature for each sensor which maintains a cumulative average reading. As time goes on, consistent sensor readings which pull this average upwards may indicate impending EOL."],"metadata":{"id":"xzxBPMv9otka"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#trainUnitsData.head()\n","trainUnitsData[\"SensorMeasurment_3_CumAvg\"] = trainUnitsData.groupby(\"UnitNumber\")[\"SensorMeasurement_3\"].apply(lambda x: x.shift().expanding().mean())\n","trainUnitsData[\"SensorMeasurment_4_CumAvg\"] = trainUnitsData.groupby(\"UnitNumber\")[\"SensorMeasurement_4\"].apply(lambda x: x.shift().expanding().mean())\n","trainUnitsData[\"SensorMeasurment_9_CumAvg\"] = trainUnitsData.groupby(\"UnitNumber\")[\"SensorMeasurement_9\"].apply(lambda x: x.shift().expanding().mean())\n","trainUnitsData[\"SensorMeasurment_11_CumAvg\"] = trainUnitsData.groupby(\"UnitNumber\")[\"SensorMeasurement_11\"].apply(lambda x: x.shift().expanding().mean())\n","trainUnitsData[\"SensorMeasurment_14_CumAvg\"] = trainUnitsData.groupby(\"UnitNumber\")[\"SensorMeasurement_14\"].apply(lambda x: x.shift().expanding().mean())\n","trainUnitsData[\"SensorMeasurment_15_CumAvg\"] = trainUnitsData.groupby(\"UnitNumber\")[\"SensorMeasurement_15\"].apply(lambda x: x.shift().expanding().mean())\n","trainUnitsData[\"SensorMeasurment_17_CumAvg\"] = trainUnitsData.groupby(\"UnitNumber\")[\"SensorMeasurement_17\"].apply(lambda x: x.shift().expanding().mean())\n","trainUnitsData.head()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":299},"id":"4C6LDEnOqUHb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647956832058,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":681,"user":{"displayName":"Adam Gilbert","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gj1KWqLKG2SAQxx8KvqzqhM94EvqxkXs2iOw7gQWQ=s64","userId":"02074648007699947871"}},"outputId":"64f3b80f-066e-41d2-a6b6-c3c0ac5e6586"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   UnitNumber  TimeCycle  SensorMeasurement_3  SensorMeasurement_4  \\\n","0           1          1              1499.45              1309.95   \n","1           1          2              1584.55              1403.96   \n","2           1          3              1368.17              1122.49   \n","3           1          4              1488.44              1249.18   \n","4           1          5              1354.48              1124.32   \n","\n","   SensorMeasurement_9  SensorMeasurement_11  SensorMeasurement_14  \\\n","0              8770.20                 45.40               8120.83   \n","1              9045.76                 47.29               8132.87   \n","2              8343.91                 41.92               8063.84   \n","3              8721.53                 44.26               8052.30   \n","4              8314.56                 41.79               8083.67   \n","\n","   SensorMeasurement_15  SensorMeasurement_17  RUL  ...
